# node-speakable

## Description

**node-speakable** is a continous-speech recognition module for node.js.

Basically, **node-speakable** is continously waiting for you to say something and waits until you finally stopped talking. It then emits an ```speechResult``` event with an ```Array()``` including of your ```spokenWords```. You can then ```.indexOf()``` the array to trigger some awesome action to happen, like turning on your ```Philips Hue``` lights.

If you ever talked to your XBOX360 (kinect) you're already familiar on how a continous-speech recognition system works for you.

## How

It's pure JavaScript magic... Ok, not yet! Currently node-speakable needs you to put a binary of ```sox``` into the modules folder to do the recording. The actual voice recognition is then achieved trough a POST to the the Google Speech API.

## Example usage (node example.js)

```javascript
var Speakable = require('./');

var speakable = new Speakable();

speakable.on('speechStart', function() {
  console.log('onSpeechStart');
});

speakable.on('speechStop', function() {
  console.log('onSpeechStop');
});

speakable.on('speechReady', function() {
  console.log('onSpeechReady');
});

speakable.on('error', function(err) {
  console.log('onError:');
  console.log(err);
  speakable.recordVoice();
});

speakable.on('speechResult', function(spokenWords) {
  console.log('onSpeechResult:')
  console.log(spokenWords);
  speakable.recordVoice();
});

speakable.recordVoice();
```

## Todo / Ideas

* Allow overwrite of speakableâ€™s defaults (sox path & parameters, etc.)
* Limit maximum listening time
